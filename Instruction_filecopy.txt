Step 1: Create S3 Buckets
	Open the AWS S3 console.
	Click "Create bucket".
	Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., source-bucket-yourname).
	Leave all other settings as default and click "Create".
	Repeat the process to create another bucket (e.g., destination-bucket-yourname).

Step 2: Create the Lambda Function
	Open the AWS Lambda console.
	Click "Create function" → Select "Author from scratch".
	Enter a function name, e.g., S3CopyFunction.
	Choose Python 3.x as the runtime.
	Click "Create function".

Step 3: Add an Environment Variable
	In the Lambda function, go to "Configuration" → "Environment variables".
	Click "Edit", then "Add environment variable".
	Enter the following:
	Key: DEST_BUCKET
	Value: destination-bucket-yourname
	Click "Save".

Step 4: Update IAM Permissions
	In the Lambda function, go to "Configuration" → "Permissions".
	Click on the IAM role name to open it in the IAM console.
	Click "Add permissions" → "Attach policies".
	Choose "Create inline policy", and use the iam_policy:
	Click "Review policy", name it (e.g., S3CopyPolicy), and click "Create policy".

Step 5: Add the Lambda Code
	Go to the "Code" tab of your Lambda function.
	Delete any existing code and replace it with the following:
	Click "Deploy".

Step 6: Set Up an S3 Trigger
	In the Lambda function, go to "Configuration" → "Triggers".
	Click "Add trigger".
	Select "S3" as the trigger source.
	Choose source-bucket-yourname from the dropdown.
	Set the Event type to "PUT" (to trigger on file uploads).
	Click "Add".

Step 7: Test the Setup
	Go to the S3 console and open source-bucket-yourname.
	Upload a test file (e.g., an image or a text file).
	Check destination-bucket-yourname to see if the file was copied automatically.
